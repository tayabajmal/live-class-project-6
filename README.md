## Learning
---
My knowledge about how the box model and flexbox works keep on increasing, project by project. Keeping track of what is flex-container and what is flex-items can be tough at times, spescially when flex-containers, also can become flex-items and the nestings keeps increasing. Must at the same time also keep track og the main axis and cross-axis, as these might change as you apply flexbox properties to your containers and items. 

Same learnings from this project as in earlier projects, such as aligning HTML elements, change properties based on hovering for menu-items and so on.
